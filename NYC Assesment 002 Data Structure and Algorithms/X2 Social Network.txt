network.like(2, 3, 3)

engagement_rates = get_engagement_rates(network)
print("Engagement Rates:", engagement_rates)

shortest_path_result = shortest_path(network, 1, 3)
print("Shortest Path:", shortest_path_result)

highest_engagement_path_result = highest_engagement_path(network, 1, 3)
print("Highest Engagement Path:", highest_engagement_path_result)
